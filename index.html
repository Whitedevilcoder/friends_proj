                    A period is a release of blood from a girl's uterus, out through her
                    vagina. It is a sign that she is getting close to the end of
                    puberty.<br> It also Menstrual blood — which is partly blood and
                    partly tissue from the inside of your uterus — flows from your
                    uterus through your cervix and out of your body through your vagina.

                    Menstruation is driven by hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers
                    in your body.<br> Your pituitary gland (in your brain) and your
                    ovaries (part of your reproductive system) make and release certain
                    hormones at certain times during your menstrual cycle.

                    <br> These hormones cause the lining of your uterus to thicken. This
                    happens so that if a pregnancy would occur, an egg can implant into
                    your uterine lining.<br> Hormones also cause your ovaries to release
                    an egg (ovulation). The egg moves down your fallopian tubes, where
                    it waits for sperm. If a sperm doesn’t fertilize that egg, pregnancy
                    doesn’t occur. The lining of your uterus breaks down and sheds. This
                    is your period.o means that she can get pregnant if she has sex.

                    Day one of your cycle is the first day of your period. This is when

                    28 days.<br>
                    After your period is over, the lining of your uterus starts to build

                    make its way to your uterus (called ovulation).<br>

                <p class="text-small">
                    People use pads or period panties to absorb menstrual flow and keep
                    them dry and leak-proof. The choice between pads and period panties
                    depends on personal preference, lifestyle, and needs. Here are some
                    factors to consider:<br>
                    <b>

                        Absorbency and flow<br>
                    </b>
                    How heavy your flow is on different days of your cycle. Pads may be
                    easier to change during the day, while period panties are more
                    convenient overnight.<br>
                    <b>

                        Activity level<br>
                    </b>
                    Period panties may be more comfortable and secure for active days or
                    workouts.<br>
                    <b>

                        Cost and lifestyle<br>

                    The upfront cost of period panties compared to the long-term savings
                    and convenience.<br>

                        Sustainability goals<br>
                    </b>
                    Both pads and period panties are more eco-friendly than disposables.
                    <br>
                    Period panties are a comfortable, low-maintenance, and eco-friendly
                    alternative to traditional period products. They are reusable, and
                    most brands can be washed in the washing machine. They also don't
                    pose a risk of toxic shock syndrome like tampons because you don't
                    insert anything into your body.
                    You can wear period panties by themselves for most people, but you
                    may choose to wear a pad too for heavy days or if you work long
                    shifts.

                </h1>
                <p class="text-small">
                    Primarily, the prevalent use of non-recyclable and non-biodegradable
                    disposable menstrual products, like sanitary pads and tampons, harms
                    the environment.<br>
                    Their lifecycle pollutes water bodies and landfills, leading to
                    microplastics and other environmental and health hazards.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b> POLLUTION DUE TO IMPROPER DISPOSAL OF PAD :</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Improperly disposing of sanitary pads can cause several
                    environmental issues, including: <br>
                    <b>

                        WATER POLLUTION:
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    Sanitary pads can end up in water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and
                    oceans, when they are flushed down toilets or dumped in other ways.
                    The chemicals in the pads, such as dioxins, phthalates, and
                    formaldehyde, can leach into the soil and contaminate the water.
                    This can harm aquatic life and potentially make its way into the
                    food chain. <br>
                    <b>

                        LANDFILL POLLUTION:<br>
                    </b>
                    Sanitary pads are non-biodegradable and non-recyclable, so they can
                    end up in landfills where they can persist for hundreds of years.
                    Landfills can also overflow, releasing harmful gases and liquids
                    into the environment.<br>
                    <b>

                        WASTE MANAGEMENT ISSUSES:<br>
                    </b>
                    Improper disposal can lead to sanitary pads clogging drains and
                    sewage systems, which can increase maintenance costs. Waste
                    management workers who handle used sanitary pads can also be exposed
                    to health hazards. <br>
                    <b>

                        PLASTIC POLLUTION :<br>
                    </b>
                    Sanitary pads can contain up to 90% plastic and other petrochemical
                    byproducts. These materials can remain in landfills for hundreds of
                    years and contribute to the growing problem of plastic pollution.
                    <br>
                    <b>

                        INCINERATOR EMISSION:<br>
                    </b>
                    Incinerators may not burn sanitary pads at high enough temperatures
                    to fully burn the plastic, and they may not have proper ventilation.
                    This can lead to the release of fumes into the air.
                    To reduce the environmental impact of sanitary pads, you can
                    consider using reusable cloth pads. Cloth pads are a cheaper option
                    than disposable pads over the long term, and they are also more
                    eco-friendly <br>

                    Tampons are non-biodegradable and can take hundreds of
                    years to decompose. They can also pollute landfills and water
                    bodies. <br>

                    The plastic packaging and disposable products of
                    menstrual products break down into microplastics, which can harm
                    marine ecosystems and ocean biomes. <br>

                    Tampons can contain dangerous chemicals like

                    The processing of raw materials used to make tampons
